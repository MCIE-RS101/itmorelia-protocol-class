# The ITMorelia Protocol Class

The present Redme file shows how to work with and compile the `Protocol-Class` in LaTeX. This class is mainly base in the `Thesis-Class`![](). If you want know what sections should be included and its content visit the **Wiki** of this repository.

# Repository structure
Below you can see the repository's contents. The repository is made of 27 files and 2 folders. The folder `Chapters` includes each `.tex` file that will be included on your portocol; later you will learn how to included. On the other hand, the folder `FrontBackMatter` folder includes `.tex` files related with common chapters/section required on protocols guides like: *Titlepage, Abstract, Colophon, Dedication, Glossary, and others*; you can include as much as you need.

In the `root` are files related with the organization and the structure of the **Protocol** (the `thesisStructure.tex` and `precontent.tex` files). Also, in `root` is included the main file that gives the special format to the document (`itmthesis.cls`), and finally the `Reference.bib` file to include a bibliography on your work.
