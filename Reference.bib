	abstract = {Energy consumption reduction efforts in the residential buildings sector represent socio-economical, technological and environmental preoccupations which justify advanced scientific research. These lead to use inverse models to describe thermal behavior and to evaluate the energy consumption of buildings. Their principal goal is to provide supporting evidence of enhanced energy performances and predictions. More specifically, research questions are related to building thermal modeling which is the most appropriate in a smart grid context. In this context, the models are reviewed according to three categories. The first category is based on physical and basic principle modeling (white-box). The second offers a much simpler structure which is the statistical models (black-box). The black-box is used for prediction of energy consumption and heating/cooling demands. Finally, the third category is a hybrid method (grey-box), which uses both physical and statistical modeling techniques. In this paper, we propose a detailed review and simulation of the main thermal building models. Our comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the grey-box is the most effective model for management of buildings energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Electrical circuit analogy is an effective method for the performance analysis of various heat transfer processes, whereas there is no equivalent thermal circuit for heat exchanger networks (HENs). In view of this limitation, and based on the concept of entransy-dissipation-based thermal resistance (EDTR), we introduce an equivalent thermal circuit to represent the heat transfer process in a heat exchanger, and then analyze the temperature variations of all the working fluids in each heat exchanger to establish the equivalent thermal circuits for such three basic layouts of HENs as multiple-loop, series, and parallel. The combination of these equivalent thermal circuits gives the overall equivalent thermal circuit for any HEN consisting of the three basic layouts. Accordingly, the inherent relationships, i.e., the constraint equations, of all the parameters in a HEN are built by circuitous philosophy. Based on these constraint equations together with the Lagrange multiplier method, we propose a mathematical method for the optimization of heat transfer performance in HENs. Finally, as an example, the heat transfer processes in a district heating system is analyzed and optimized by the newly proposed equivalent thermal circuit and the corresponding optimization method to show the applications.},

@article{Park2011b,
	abstract = {In order to reduce heat energy demand in residential building, thermal insulation and indoor air tightness become more important. However, in a well-insulated environment, internal heat gain caused by solar radiation, metabolism and losses of home electric appliance (i.e. refrigerator, lamp, television, etc.) can be dominant to home global energy management. To quantify and to modelize the heat gain due to home appliances, we begin experimental measurements in a well-insulated room. The first step in this work is the identification of the room. In this paper we suggest a 1R1C lumped parameter circuit which presents a building thermal model using thermal-electric analogy. Then, we identify the circuit components (the global thermal resistor and the global thermal capacitor) from the heat balance equation and experimental results. Based on the model and the obtained parameters, we simulate the indoor temperature of the model using Matlab/Simulink. To check its accuracy we compare the measured data and simulation results and calculate their error ratio.},

@article{Ramirez-Laboreo2014a,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Modeling and identification of thermal systems is a problem frequently treated in theoretical and application domains. Most of these systems have been modeled using black-box structures whose parameters are identified using temperature measurements. Although black-box models have achieved good results in terms of temperature evolution, they cannot model variables which had not been measured in the identification test. In this article we present a new method to build grey-box thermal models based on electrical equivalent circuits which not only give information about temperatures evolution, but also about heat fluxes and thermal energy stored in the system. The partially unknown parameters of the models are identified using temperature measurements and applying nonlinear optimization techniques. The obtained state space representation can be used to develop a deterministic state space temperature controller that provides better accuracy than classical PID controllers. Our proposal is complemented with various examples of a real application in an electric oven.},

@article{Goyal2011,
	abstract = {Constructing a model of thermal dynamics of a multi-zone building requires modeling heat conduction through walls as well as convection due to air-flows among the zones. Reduced order models of conduction in terms of RC-networks are well established, while currently the only way to model convection is through CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). This limits convection models to a single zone or a small number of zones in a building. In this paper we present a novel method of identifying a reduced order thermal model of a multi-zone building from measured space temperature data. The method consists of first identifying the underlying network structure, in particular, the paths of convective interaction among zones, which corresponds to edges of a building graph. Convective interaction among a pair of zones is modeled as a RC network, in a manner analogous to conduction models. The second step of the proposed method involves estimating the parameters of the RC network model for the convection edges. The identified convection edges, along with the associated R and C values, are used to augment a thermal dynamics model of a building that is originally constructed to model only conduction. Predictions by the augmented model and the conduction-only model are compared with space temperatures measured in a multi-zone building in the University of Florida campus. The identified model is seen to predict the temperatures more accurately than a conduction-only model.},
